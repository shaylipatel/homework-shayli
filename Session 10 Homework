SCRUM CEREMONIES
•Product backlog refinement
It creates a shared understanding on what the Product will, and won’t, do, on the effort it will take to implement it, and the order in which you’ll do that.
It is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate to ensure that items on the Product Backlog:
- are understood the same way by all involved (shared understanding),
- have a size estimate for the (relative) complexity and effort of their implementation, and
- are ordered according to their priority in terms of business value and effort required.

•Sprint planning
Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint.
The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved.
Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.
The sprint planning session kicks off the sprint by setting the agenda and focus.
If done correctly, it also creates an environment where the team is motivated, challenged, and can be successful.

•Daily scrum
It is usually a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team which focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.
It is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.
Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.
The Scrum Master ensures that the meeting happens, but the Developers are responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum.

•Sprint review
The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment.
Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.
The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities.
The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.
The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint.
For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
The Sprint Review includes the following elements:
- Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;
- The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;
- The Developers discuss what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;
- The Developers demonstrate the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;
- The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands.
They projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed);
- The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning;
- Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next;
- Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality and capability of the product.
Result
The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint.
The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.

•Sprint retrospective
Sprint retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.
The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.
The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.
The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint.
For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

SCRUM ROLES
•ScrumMaster
The scrum master helps to facilitate scrum to the larger team by ensuring the scrum framework is followed.
Scrum masters act as coaches to the rest of the team.
They are committed to the scrum values and practices, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow.

•Product Owner
A Scrum Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.
The product owner should not only understand the customer, but also have a vision for the value the scrum team is delivering to the customer.
The product owner also balances the needs of other stakeholders in the organization.
The product owner must take all these inputs and prioritize the work.


The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:
- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
- Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

•Development Team.
Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, programmers, etc.
The development team should be able to self-organize so they can make decisions to get work done.
The development team, like the production support team, can make decisions and deliver the fix/value for the problem at hand.
The development team’s responsibilities include:
- Delivering the work through the sprint.
- To ensure transparency during the sprint they meet daily at the daily scrum

Question 2
You are leading a development team that was given a task to create a new yoga booking system.
High level description of the system is as follows:
• It has a very simple interface to accept user input (bookings) and display classes information
• All bookings, appointments, schedule etc should be stored in a SQL database.
• There is ‘backend’ system that should be written in Python to handle the logic and manage
the data flow.
Your team has two weeks to build a simple prototype that will be shown to the client to seek their
feedback and discuss further enhancements.

SQL
1. Create database for New Yoga Co. in SQL
2. Create the following tables in New Yoga Co database
- user information
- instructor information
- class bookings
- user orders
- schedule

Python
3. Create 'Create new account' backend - use input functions for user info and billing info. Connect this to SQL database - user information table
4. Create 'Timetable' backend where users can see how many spaces are available. Connect this to SQL database - class booking table and timetable.
5. Create 'Instructor' page - print the instructor information - connect to SQL database - instructor information
6. Create a booking system for existing users only where spaces are available in the class. Connect this SQL database - booking system.

7. Create a flask app, with different pages for creating accout, timetable, the booking system.
